# PV Solar Project Hub

This repository is a central collection of research, plans, and documentation for a comprehensive DIY solar power system. The goal is to document how I designed and built a robust, scalable, and multi-functional solar installation on the top of a 20ft shipping container.

## Project Components

This project is broken down into several key areas. See the documents below for detailed information on each component.

*   **[Mounting & Ballast System](./docs/mounting_and_ballast.md)**: How to secure the solar panel array to a shipping container roof without drilling holes, including concepts for thermal integration.

*   **[Solar Panel Array](./docs/solar_panel_array.md)**: Research into which solar panels to use, how many are needed, and how they will be configured.

*   **[Inverter & Power Control](./docs/inverter_system.md)**: Details on the all-in-one MPPT solar controller, charger, and inverter.

*   **[Battery Bank](./docs/battery_bank.md)**: Design and specifications for the LiFePO4 battery bank.
