# Floating Garden Biofilter System

This document describes a standalone, closed-loop floating garden system that combines rainwater harvesting, biological filtration, and thermal integration using low-energy methods. The system is designed for off-grid or low-impact environments and integrates naturally into rooftop or container-top spaces.

---

## Overview

The system is composed of:

- Two staggered rain barrels:
  - Upper Barrel: insulated, receives lifted water and integrates a cooling coil
  - Lower Barrel: open, shaded, contains a floating garden and biological substrate
- Floating garden raft with nutrient-absorbing plants
- Substrate bed (gravel â†’ sand) for mechanical and microbial filtration
- Airlift bubbler system to circulate water from lower to upper barrel
- Passive overflow return from upper to lower barrel

---

## System Flow

1. Rainwater collects in the upper barrel
2. Water flows downward into the lower garden barrel via gravity or overflow
3. Water is:
   - Exposed to plant roots for biological filtration
   - Pulled through a substrate bed (gravel + sand) at the bottom for mechanical/microbial treatment
4. A bubbler-based airlift system pulls clean water from the bottom of the lower tank
5. Water is lifted into the upper barrel and optionally circulated through a thermal coil
6. Overflow from the upper barrel returns to the lower garden barrel

## Functional Goals

| Goal | Achieved by |
|------|-------------|
| Rainwater storage | Upper and lower barrels collect and cycle water |
| Water purification | Floating garden + gravel/sand bed + oxygenation |
| Oxygenation | Airlift pump naturally aerates water |
| Low energy use | Airlift pump powered by small solar panel |
| Thermal regulation | Cooling or heating coil in upper barrel |

## Components & Design Notes

### Barrels
- Upper barrel should be insulated and partially shaded if used for thermal storage
- Lower barrel must be open to light but shaded from extreme heat; protected from debris

### Floating Garden
- Floating raft with net cups for aquatic or semi-aquatic plants
- Roots hang into the water for nutrient absorption and filtration

### Substrate Filtration Zone
- Intake at the bottom surrounded by:
  - Coarse rocks
  - Mesh screen
  - Gravel and sand layers
- Prevents particulate clogging and allows bacterial action

### Airlift System
- Uses a single low-pressure airline from an aquarium-style air pump
- Pulls water up from the intake zone through a vertical riser
- Simultaneously oxygenates and lifts water

### Overflow Channel
- Pipe from top barrel to lower garden tank
- Should be slightly below the top fill line of the upper barrel
- Can be decorated as a trickle waterfall or silent sleeve

### Cooling Coil
- Optional heat-exchange loop inside the upper barrel
- Can be used to cool hot water from solar systems or store usable thermal energy

## Future Expansion Ideas

- Wicking bed connection for overflow reuse
- Inline UV treatment for drinking-grade water
- Thermal storage layering inside upper barrel
- Modular rafts with movable net pots
- Float switch for triggering other systems

## Status
- [ ] Initial design and modeling complete
- [ ] Materials list and build instructions in progress
- [ ] Temperature and filtration performance testing pending

Contributions welcome. Add diagrams, performance data, or test results as this system evolves.
